STL Deque is data structure implementation that is a part of the Standard Template Library. Deque, also known as "Dequeue" or "Deck", is a complex acronym for "Double-Ended Queue".
At its core, Deque is a Linear list in which insertion and deletion are allowed from both ends of the list. Due to the nature of the data structure, Deques 
can be implemented in place of stacks, queues, and oftentimes vectors.
